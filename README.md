## Originality and innovation

- Decoupled API
- Language independent
- Open to future extensions (Hexagonal Architecture)
- Use of transaction identifiers (UUID)
- OTP submission and verification
- Designed for large flow of requests (Reactive Architecture)

## Technical Viability

In order to ofer a excelent service to our the customer 

Our MVP of the API is going to be developed with the next stack of technologies:

- Java 11

- Reactive Language(Reactor + WebFlux)
- Twilio

In future steps when the application grows we are going to need more technologies with the purpose of giving to user high availability:

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- AWS
- Message Broker -> Which one?
- Load Balancer -> ?
